# WebScraping
Following the Medium introduction to building a webscraper (https://medium.com/@joerosborne/intro-to-web-scraping-build-your-first-scraper-in-5-minutes-1c36b5c4b110)

The domain used is example.com because as stated in the article, many high trafic websites can have bot detection that can be hard to bypass  
In the future Id like to create a price comparison tool to help me in my day to day shopping, or when looking to shop online and find the best deal in a certain reveiw space, eg yarn less than Â£10 with more than 4 stars on amazon  
I have no prior knowledge of how webscrapers work so this is also a big learning opertunity for me, I thought this would also be a good first step in learning how to create an API  

Following a text tutorial while also trying to demonstrate my learning can be difficult, as such Ill use most of the code directly from the article while commenting accordingly based on what i learn  



With how easy it was to create the webscraper, Id like to create a simple project to create a shopping list off the ingredients on a recipie site  
Any plans will be attached in post
